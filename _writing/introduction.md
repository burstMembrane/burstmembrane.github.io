# INTRODUCTION

We live in a world increasingly mediated by computing technologies. The Internet of Things is making steady progress into people’s lives, homes and workplaces through smartphones, smart appliances, and smart algorithms. This technology connects individuals and global networks in pervasive, sometimes overwhelming, ways. The increased reliance on these tools raises important questions about their effect on human behaviour and wellbeing. The simultaneous use of computing technologies for social and economic participation and profit-seeking data extraction by corporations asks that their functions be closely examined. My project exposes the connection between raw and mediated data. Computer algorithms collect data; sorting and thresholding it via arbitrary or pseudo-random parameters. In my work this is recontextualized and output within space and presented to show the processes I have applied. To start with, a physical site is captured as data, then mediated by computer-driven processing, and finally output into another site. Using algorithmic processing, data extraction, and open-sourced coding tools, I utilize within a contemporary art context the same technological vocabulary that enacts digital surveillance in order to expose its functions and meaning. 

The first chapter establishes a research methodology and aims for this project. I define the critical lens through which my practice and research should be viewed, highlighting the theoretical underpinnings which drive my creative processes throughout the year.

The second chapter explores the notion of surveillance as it has evolved in the digital era. The processes and technologies that make this possible are explained and critiqued. I, then, go on to discuss the emergent logic of Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff 2015) and Hito Steyerl’s (2013) views on the offline effect of online technologies in contemporary art. The commodification of the art object (Groys 2017) in relation to technology is briefly mentioned, before an explanation of these themes as they relate to my practice. 

The third chapter revisits Guy Debord’s seminal text “The Society of the Spectacle” (Debord 1967) in relation to contemporary surveillance capitalism. How the Spectacle manifests itself in the digital everyday through the proposed “cognitive exploitation” (Barile 2017, p.152) of users is also examined.  The chapter concludes with a discussion of my working processes, towards the creation of works of art that subvert or critique exploitation of users through the Situationist’s technique of detournement and Hito Steyerl’s Circulationism.  

The fourth chapter continues my discussion of working processes, particularly with regard to the coding of my own algorithms and the interface used to show them. The processes of computer vision: thresholding, aggregation and cropping are explained. I then look at my development of an interface as the modulation of digital data through the work of David Rokeby (1998) and Clemens/Nash (2015). I conclude with considerations surrounding the spectator’s interaction with the work through an interface. 

Finally, chapter five sees my hybrid video/algorithmic work in relation to a global network of artists. I use both contemporary and historical artworks to link the ideas of big data and surveillance with contemporary art practices as well as considerations regarding video, media and the interface.
